Runtime Patches for Library Compatibility Issues

This module provides runtime patches for known compatibility issues in dependencies.
Import and call patches at the top of CLI entry points BEFORE importing QSDsan/biosteam.

    Patch fluids.numerics.PY37 attribute for compatibility with thermo<=0.4.2.

    Issue: fluids>=1.2 removed the PY37 flag, but thermo<=0.4.2 (QSDsan dependency)
    still checks for it. This causes AttributeError during QSDsan imports.

    Solution: Inject the flag at runtime before any QSDsan/biosteam imports.

    - CalebBell/fluids: Removed PY37 in v1.2
    - CalebBell/thermo: Still uses numerics.PY37 check in v0.4.2
